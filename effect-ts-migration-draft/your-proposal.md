## Living status

Current migration state:

- Previous completed checkpoint: `90f4383` Test registry Effect service.
- Active checkpoint: extend `flarex-protocol` to the DeploymentDO abandon-push boundary while keeping DeploymentDO SQL/router behavior unchanged.
- Effect version: use the workspace catalog `effect@4.0.0-beta.90`. Treat "Effect v4" in this repo as the current v4 beta line until a stable v4 exists.
- Reviewer rule: Effect migration checkpoints use only `.codex/agents/effect-ts-quality-checker.toml`; do not also run the legacy TypeScript/code-quality reviewers for the same checkpoint.

Current Goal 4 slice:

1. Add `flarex-protocol/deployment` for the narrow `POST /push/:id/abandon` boundary.
2. Define `AbandonPushRequest`, `PushStatus`, and `DeploymentProtocolValidationError` with Effect Schema.
3. Convert only DeploymentDO abandon body decoding to the protocol parser; keep SQL, push state transitions, and route shape unchanged.
4. Parse successful abandon responses in focused backend tests through `parsePushStatus`.
5. Keep deep deployment `analysis` and `codegenAnalysis` payload schemas for a later deployment-analysis slice; this checkpoint validates the stable PushStatus envelope and abandon request.

Completed Goal 3 slice:

1. Add service-level tests for `RegistryService` without Miniflare.
2. Provide `RegistryStore`, `RegistryClock`, and `RegistryIds` through test layers.
3. Prove explicit deployment IDs, generated deployment IDs, controlled timestamps, list response wrapping, and typed `RegistrySqlError` propagation.
4. Keep `RegistryDO.fetch()` route behavior unchanged.
5. Keep reusable Registry service methods as named `Effect.fn` functions.

Completed Goal 2 slice:

1. Keep `flarex-protocol` as the narrow schema-first Registry contract package from the previous checkpoint.
2. Add `packages/flarex-backend/src/registry/` with:
   - `Store.ts` for Durable Object SQLite access and typed `RegistrySqlError`.
   - `Runtime.ts` for Effect-backed clock/id services instead of hidden `Date.now()` and `crypto.randomUUID()` in domain logic.
   - `Service.ts` for registry behavior implemented with `Context.Service`, `Layer`, and reusable `Effect.fn` methods.
   - `Layer.ts` for per-DO layer composition.
3. Keep `RegistryDO.fetch()` as the non-Effect HTTP host for now, with one `ManagedRuntime.runPromise(...)` boundary per handler branch.
4. Do not introduce `HttpApiBuilder`, Alchemy, executor-http replacement, or a large module move in this slice.
5. Preserve the existing route behavior and validate with focused RegistryDO tests plus backend typecheck/build/test gates.

Next checkpoint after Goal 4 should be one of:

- Extend `flarex-protocol/deployment` to source package and analyzed push start schemas.
- Spike `HttpApiBuilder` for RegistryDO only if the current plain-router + Effect-service split remains clean.

My take: yes, this is the right **roadmap direction**, but I would not execute it as written. It is too large to be an implementation plan.

The diagnosis is accurate. `packages/flarex-backend/src/worker.ts` has a large manual router starting at [worker.ts](C:/Users/Admin/Documents/github/convex-backend/custom/cloudflare-executor/packages/flarex-backend/src/worker.ts:102), with repeated `readJson` boundary casts throughout. The shared HTTP layer is tiny and unchecked at runtime: [http.ts](C:/Users/Admin/Documents/github/convex-backend/custom/cloudflare-executor/packages/flarex-backend/src/http.ts:27). `executor-http` also repeats Elysia route registration and manual `request.json()` parsing: [index.ts](C:/Users/Admin/Documents/github/convex-backend/custom/cloudflare-executor/packages/executor-http/src/index.ts:209). So schema-first contracts and typed error mapping would be a real improvement, not cosmetic cleanup.

The best parts of the plan:

- Keep `apps/backend` as infrastructure/deployment ownership and keep `packages/flarex-backend` reusable runtime code.
- Do not convert the frontend SDK during this refactor.
- Do not replace `ValidatorJson` with Effect Schema. Use Effect Schema for transport/API/service contracts; keep `ValidatorJson` for user document/function validation.
- Convert `PartitionDO` last or late. It owns correctness-sensitive OCC/SQL behavior, so schema wrapping and service extraction must be separate from logic changes.
- Start with `RegistryDO`. It is small enough to prove the pattern: [registryDO.ts](C:/Users/Admin/Documents/github/convex-backend/custom/cloudflare-executor/packages/flarex-backend/src/registryDO.ts:27).

What I would change:

- Do **not** start with Alchemy. Keep `wrangler.jsonc` as the source of truth until Worker/DO class boundaries are stable. Alchemy can be a later app-level deployment slice.
- Do **not** replace Elysia in `executor-http` as an early proof. First extract schemas and parity tests; replace the router only after behavior is locked.
- Do **not** do a huge module-folder move before proving the Effect pattern. File moves make review noisy and hide behavior changes.
- Treat `HttpApi` inside Durable Objects as a spike, not a given. If it compiles cleanly and keeps DO instance lifecycle sane, good. If it adds too much ceremony, use Effect Schema at the boundary while keeping plain `fetch` routers for a while.

The first real slice I'd do:

1. Add a tiny `flarex-protocol` package with only `Json`, `CreateDeploymentRequest`, `DeploymentRecord`, and registry response schemas.
2. Convert `RegistryDO` to decode with those schemas, but keep its current routes and SQL behavior.
3. Add/extend Miniflare tests for create/list deployment, invalid JSON, invalid body, duplicate/update behavior.
4. Run `pnpm --filter flarex-backend typecheck` and focused backend tests.
5. Only then decide whether to introduce `HttpApiBuilder` for `RegistryDO`.

So: approve the direction, but downgrade the pasted plan to a roadmap. The immediate implementation plan should be "protocol schemas plus RegistryDO proof," not "Effect/Alchemy/module-layout migration."

Alchemy references to verify during the later spike: [Effect HTTP API](https://v2.alchemy.run/guides/effect-http-api/) and [Durable Objects](https://v2.alchemy.run/tutorial/cloudflare/durable-objects/).
