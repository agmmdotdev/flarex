# Private Store Currency HTTP

This package serves `GET /store/currencies` and `GET /store/currencies/:code`.
The pinned Medusa handlers use their original route middleware, validators,
field selection and response envelopes. The Store namespace supplies CORS,
publishable-key validation, locale handling and optional customer authentication.

`createStoreCurrencyHttpHandler` takes the Store origin policy and a factory
that creates a scope for each request. Register the Currency `remoteQuery`,
the publishable-key and Sales Channel `query.graph`, and a logger. A trusted
host can supply a verified customer identity or a server-backed session.

Use `makeStoreCurrencyEffectHttpHandler` from `@flarex/medusa-http/effect` to
mount the namespace in a scoped Effect HTTP host. Closing its scope releases
the Web handler.

The build-time manifest lives in `static-manifest.json`. Run `pnpm generate`
after changing its route or middleware entries. Run `pnpm check:generated`
to verify the checked-in static imports against the framework renderer.
