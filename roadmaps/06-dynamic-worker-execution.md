# Dynamic Worker Execution

## Current Decision

User code should run in Dynamic Workers and receive only restricted syscall
APIs. User code must not receive raw Durable Object stubs, SQLite handles, or
environment bindings.

## Intended Flow

```txt
Worker router
  -> resolve deployment and partition
  -> begin transaction in PartitionDO
  -> run user function in Dynamic Worker
  -> syscalls collect reads and staged writes
  -> commit through PartitionDO
```

## Implemented So Far

`apps/backend/src/transaction.ts` defines `SingleShardTransaction`, the first
backend syscall-facing transaction layer. It is not a Dynamic Worker executor
yet, but it is the object the executor should use to service future `ctx.db`
syscalls:

- `get(tableId, id)`
- `queryIndex({ indexId, lower, upper, limit })`
- `insert(tableId, value, id?)`
- `replace(tableId, id, value)`
- `patch(tableId, id, value)`
- `delete(tableId, id)`
- `commit({ source, idempotencyKey })`

The Dynamic Worker should receive a restricted API backed by this wrapper, not
raw Durable Object bindings, raw SQLite handles, or the Cloudflare `env`.

`apps/backend/src/invoke.ts` defines the first backend invoke boundary:

- `executeInvoke(env, deploymentId, request, functions)`
- `BackendFunctionRegistry`
- query and mutation contexts backed by `SingleShardTransaction`
- table-name resolution through `DeploymentDO` for
  `ctx.db.insert("tableName", value)`
- per-invoke schema cache sync from `DeploymentDO` to target `PartitionDO`
  before transaction begin
- `ctx.db.get(id)` returns a developer-facing document value with `_id`
- `/deployments/:deploymentId/invoke`
- top-level `/invoke` with `deploymentId` in the body or
  `x-flarex-deployment` header

The Worker route currently uses an empty backend function registry. This is
intentional until the Dynamic Worker bridge or deployed function registry is
implemented.

`apps/backend/src/executionDO.ts` adds the first backend execution-session
syscall protocol:

- `POST /deployments/:deploymentId/executions/start`
- `POST /deployments/:deploymentId/executions/:sessionId/syscall`
- `POST /deployments/:deploymentId/executions/:sessionId/finish`
- `POST /deployments/:deploymentId/executions/:sessionId/abort`

`ExecutionDO` owns one active `SingleShardTransaction` session. It validates
deployed function args at `/start`, services restricted `ctx.db` operations
through `/syscall`, validates returns at `/finish`, and only then commits
mutations through `PartitionDO`.

The generated Worker now runs user handlers with a scoped syscall-backed
`ctx.db` client. It no longer stores documents in its own generated
`PartitionDO`; it calls the authoritative backend service binding instead.

## Cloudflare Difference

Convex isolates user code with its own Rust/V8 infrastructure. Flarex should
use Cloudflare runtime isolation, but must still enforce the same architectural
boundary: user code sees `ctx.db`, not storage.

## Known Limitations

- The Dynamic Worker path is still generated Worker code, not Cloudflare's
  production Dynamic Worker upload/deployment flow.
- Execution sessions currently keep transaction state in one `ExecutionDO`
  instance's memory. If a session DO is evicted mid-execution, the session is
  lost and must be retried by a future executor layer.
- The production Worker route has no deployed function registry yet, so it
  reports unknown functions until the Dynamic Worker bridge is connected.
- There is no executor retry loop around `OCC_CONFLICT` yet.
- Index reads through the wrapper do not yet overlay staged writes.
- Cross-shard calls remain intentionally out of scope for normal mutations.

## Last Update

Added the backend invoke boundary on top of `SingleShardTransaction`.
`executeInvoke` executes registered query or mutation handlers against a safe
`ctx.db` wrapper, commits mutations through `PartitionDO`, returns read sets for
queries, and maps partition commit errors back to HTTP responses. It now loads
schema from `DeploymentDO`, syncs the target partition cache before begin,
resolves table names for inserts, and returns developer-facing documents with
`_id` from `ctx.db.get`. The Worker has `/deployments/:deploymentId/invoke` and
top-level `/invoke` routes.

Convex inspiration:

- `crates/isolate/src/environment/udf/syscall.rs`
- `crates/function_runner/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/application/src/application_function_runner/mod.rs`
- `crates/application/src/api.rs`

Cloudflare difference: Convex's syscall machinery is inside its V8/Rust
function runner and is reached through `ApplicationApi`. Flarex starts with a
TypeScript invoke executor that calls a tenant-scoped `PartitionDO`; the Dynamic
Worker bridge still needs to provide the actual deployed function registry.

Verified with:

```sh
corepack pnpm --filter @flarex/backend typecheck
corepack pnpm --filter @flarex/backend test
corepack pnpm --filter @flarex/backend build
```

## Execution Session Update

Added the first backend syscall session bridge. The generated Worker now:

1. Validates local function args with generated metadata.
2. Calls backend `/executions/start` with deployment, partition, path, kind,
   args, and idempotency key.
3. Builds `ctx.db` as a scoped syscall client.
4. Sends each `ctx.db.get/query/insert/patch/delete` to backend `/syscall`.
5. Validates the return locally for fast failure.
6. Calls backend `/finish`; backend validates the return again and commits
   mutations through `PartitionDO`.
7. Calls `/abort` if user code or local validation fails.

Convex inspiration:

- `crates/isolate/src/environment/udf/syscall.rs`
- `crates/function_runner/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/udf/src/validation.rs`
- `crates/application/src/application_function_runner/mod.rs`

Cloudflare difference: Convex keeps the function runner and transaction
machinery inside Rust/V8 process boundaries. Flarex uses a Worker service
binding and a per-session Durable Object to preserve the same separation while
letting user code run in Cloudflare's runtime.

Verified with:

```sh
corepack pnpm typecheck
corepack pnpm test
```

## Generated Worker E2E Update

Added an end-to-end generated Worker test in the example app. The test runs:

```txt
generated app Worker /invoke
  -> FLAREX_BACKEND service binding
  -> backend /executions/start
  -> backend /executions/:sessionId/syscall
  -> backend /executions/:sessionId/finish
  -> PartitionDO commit
```

The test deploys schema and generated function metadata to the backend harness,
invokes `lessons:complete`, then invokes `lessons:list` through the generated
Worker and verifies the write is read back through the backend index path.

Fixed the query syscall result contract while adding this test. Query syscalls
now return the SDK runtime envelope:

```ts
{ page, isDone, continueCursor }
```

instead of a raw document array. This matches `createQueryInitializer`, whose
`collect`, `paginate`, `first`, and `unique` helpers expect a paginated result
shape.

Convex inspiration remains the syscall boundary in:

- `crates/isolate/src/environment/udf/syscall.rs`
- `crates/function_runner/src/lib.rs`

Cloudflare difference: this test uses a Miniflare service binding function to
connect the generated Worker harness to the backend harness. Production should
use the real Worker service binding configured in generated Wrangler output.

Verified with:

```sh
corepack pnpm --filter @flarex/example test
corepack pnpm typecheck
corepack pnpm test
```
