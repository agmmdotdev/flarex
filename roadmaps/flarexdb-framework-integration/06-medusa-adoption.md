# Medusa Adoption

## Status And Scope

Status: accepted source-backed sequence; no Flarex-backed Medusa adapter is
implemented or production-authorized

This plan owns the ordered adoption of the Medusa fork onto FlarexDB reserved
relational storage. It preserves Medusa's DML, module, repository, Query, Link,
workflow, locking, idempotency, and commerce-event semantics.

It does not turn Medusa tables into public application tables or make Flarex
core depend on Medusa.

## Current Source Findings

The current fork demonstrates important compatibility surfaces:

- modules currently consume the mature `@medusajs/utils/dml/model` grammar,
  whose models include scalar fields, indexes, checks, defaults, soft-delete
  behavior, and relationship metadata;
- the newer `@medusajs/dml` implementation is currently scalar-only even though
  its types describe relationships, so it is not the module grammar to mirror;
- repository contracts include transaction reuse, list/count/query, create,
  update, upsert, delete, soft delete, restore, and relation replacement;
- static module manifests provide a Worker-safe alternative to filesystem
  discovery;
- `Context.transactionManager` is the existing transaction propagation seam;
- Module Joiner and Link definitions carry endpoint, alias, cardinality,
  cascade, extra-data, and read-only semantics; and
- custom repositories and Query require more than basic generated CRUD.

The current Drizzle proof is not yet a production adapter:

- prepared module models are held in mutable module-global state while static
  modules may load concurrently;
- its generated Drizzle migration adapter intentionally throws from the
  optional run/revert methods and therefore does not provide the Flarex-managed
  production migration lifecycle;
- link modules still use MikroORM entity generation and PostgreSQL
  introspection/diff logic; and
- Link uniqueness uses an application precheck that storage must close under
  concurrency.

## Ownership Boundary

FlarexDB owns:

- scope-qualified physical lowering;
- schema artifact, installation, migration receipt, readiness, and binding;
- columns, indexes, checks, constraints, and transaction enforcement;
- transaction settlement and commit publication;
- optional derived adjacency and storage observability; and
- backup, restore, repair, and operator mechanics.

Medusa owns:

- DML authoring and normalization;
- static module manifests and dependency injection;
- complete module-set coordination;
- Joiner aliases, linkable keys, and Module Link meaning;
- repository and custom-repository behavior;
- query-option, Query, RemoteJoiner, GraphQL, and index planning;
- Link attach/dismiss and lifecycle;
- workflows, locks, idempotency, and commerce events; and
- semantic migration and data-backfill intent.

## Module-Scoped Persistence Preparation

Replace process-global prepared-model state with an immutable module-scoped
binding:

```text
prepareModule(module identity, normalized models, repositories, capabilities)
  -> PreparedModulePersistence
```

The result captures the exact module schema subset and authorized relational
handles. Loading another module cannot change it.

All module preparations and resolved links then feed one coordinator. Here,
"complete" means the complete configured supported module/link set for that
candidate, not every module in the commerce universe:

```text
static manifests
  -> normalize actual DML
  -> collect module ownership and capabilities
  -> resolve Joiner and Module Links
  -> finalize complete configured candidate set
  -> compile one owner-qualified artifact whose payload is RelationalSchema
```

Do not create a third DML grammar. Normalize the mature Medusa model once and
compile its value output into Flarex `RelationalSchema`.

## Initial Compatibility Profile

The first supported environment is deliberately narrow:

- one pinned Medusa fork revision;
- one homogeneous configured supported module/link set per candidate; the
  first candidate may contain Currency alone;
- one shared physical relational installation;
- scope-qualified reserved tables and constraints;
- static manifests rather than runtime filesystem discovery; and
- no per-scope custom schema or staggered module generation.

Unsupported modules, repository capabilities, link shapes, triggers, or
migration requirements fail admission before serving traffic.

## Implementation Sequence

### Source and contract preflight

- Pin the exact fork revision, package graph, license, and supported module set.
- Consolidate the actual mature DML parser and current Drizzle compiler inputs.
- Inventory repository, transaction, custom-query, Query, Link, workflow, lock,
  idempotency, event, and migration contracts.
- Produce supported, deferred, and rejected capability matrices.
- Freeze module-scoped preparation and dependency direction.

### Schema admission

- Compile the complete configured normalized module/link set for the candidate
  into canonical `RelationalSchema` values.
- Admit provenance, deterministic encoding, digest, and unsupported-capability
  failures.
- Generate no public application schema and expose no raw database handle.

### Commerce transaction-host admission

- Complete the separate transaction-owner preflight before receipt-family
  implementation or any Currency write.
- Prove Flarex-owned scoped physical transaction acquisition, binding
  revalidation, isolation, timeout, interruption, commit, rollback, and
  settlement.
- Adapt Medusa's transaction-manager contract and nested propagation without
  giving Medusa or a repository the raw physical handle or finalizer.
- Freeze lock order and the point at which the canonical publication lock is
  acquired after lane work.

### Commerce-row commit and event-intent admission

- Complete the separate commit-owner preflight before any Currency write.
- Add typed commerce-row mutation receipts and facts to the common finalizer.
- Add only the pinned typed Medusa event-intent contracts required by the
  Currency behavior under test.
- Persist each admitted event intent with the same commit and common outbox
  wake, then dispatch by stable identity with durable retry and delivery state.
- Introduce no temporary publication path, arbitrary event envelope, second
  feed, or second outbox.

### Currency baseline

- Produce a fresh baseline for the Currency module.
- Install through the migration coordinator.
- Bind a scope-pinned commerce transaction manager.
- Adapt generated repository operations.
- Run unchanged Currency service and relevant integration tests.
- Prove scope isolation, uniqueness, rollback, transaction-local reads, and
  authoritative transaction settlement in genuine PostgreSQL.
- Prove each accepted write publishes its typed commerce-row fact, any admitted
  event intent, and the common outbox wake in the same commit.

### Product event-intent expansion

- Before the first Product create, update, delete, relation replacement, or
  restore proof, inventory the exact events emitted by the unchanged Product
  service behavior.
- Complete the event-intent commit-owner extension and admit those typed
  contracts into the existing durable intent/finalizer path.
- Reject the Product mutation vertical until this admission is active.

### Product relationships

- Normalize the current Drizzle compiler's existing physical foreign-key and
  implicit many-to-many pivot behavior into a Medusa-owned artifact.
- Prove its deterministic Flarex lowering, filtering, population, replacement,
  deletion, and migration behavior.
- Keep Query and cross-module links outside this step.

### First Link endpoint candidate

- Select one real non-read-only Module Link and both exact endpoint modules from
  the pinned supported source set.
- Add, compile, install, and prove the second endpoint module with Product as one
  complete configured candidate before any Link mutation; before event-intent
  admission, its executable proof is limited to schema, startup, and read-only
  repository behavior.
- Inventory every domain event emitted by the unchanged endpoint services and
  Link behavior.

### Commerce-link commit admission

- Complete the separate commit-owner preflight for the commerce-link family.
- Add a transaction-bound commerce-link receipt and typed fact to the common
  finalizer before the first stored Module Link can write.
- Admit the exact typed event-intent contracts emitted by both endpoint modules
  and the Link behavior before executing them.
- Preserve the existing commit order and common outbox authority.

### First Module Link

- Prove any required second-endpoint mutations only after its event-intent
  contracts are admitted.
- Compile one stored resolved link with real cardinality and lifecycle.
- Enforce uniqueness/cardinality atomically in storage.
- Prove attach, dismiss, soft delete, restore, `deleteCascade`, the pinned
  duplicate/retry outcomes, and concurrency.
- Add a derived adjacency projection only if measured query or sync needs
  justify it.

### Custom repositories and Query

- Admit repository-specific relational query capabilities one use case at a
  time.
- Keep custom-query capabilities read-only; add a dedicated receipt-producing
  operation for every admitted custom write.
- Translate Medusa query shapes in the adapter.
- Preserve module-service and Query semantics.
- Do not create a public universal query AST.

### Workflows and locks

- Prove transaction boundaries around workflow steps.
- Do not hold database locks across workflow pauses or remote effects.
- Adapt lock and idempotency stores through their own bounded capabilities.
- Test crash, replay, duplicate delivery, timeout, and lost-response behavior.

## Migration Policy

Fresh installs compile a baseline from the pinned complete configured supported
module/link set for the candidate. Later upgrades combine structural artifact
differences with explicit Medusa-owned semantic transformations.

Historical MikroORM/Postgres migrations remain legacy-backend evidence. They
are translated only when a proven compatibility obligation requires a
particular behavior. Production startup verifies the active commerce digest
and never silently applies DDL.

## Exit Criteria For Private Integration

- All admitted modules use module-scoped immutable preparation.
- Complete module/link compilation is deterministic.
- Runtime binds to exactly one active commerce digest.
- Unchanged claimed Medusa tests pass against the Flarex adapter.
- Real PostgreSQL proves transaction, constraint, lock, concurrency, and
  migration behavior.
- Commerce writes publish through one Flarex commit/feed/outbox authority.
- No public application API can access reserved commerce rows.
- Unsupported capabilities fail closed before startup.
- Hosted, operator, scale, observability, and production activation remain
  separate gates.
